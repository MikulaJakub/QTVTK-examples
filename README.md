Qt + VTK examples


I wrote these minimalistic examples to learn more about Qt and VTK myself and share that knowledge with others . Many of these examples are my own 'experiments', and therefore they may not be written in the most efficient way, rather they demonstrate how things can be done.


The examples currently include:

- user defined class inherited from a VTK class [VTK-user-defined-class]
- plot and interact with a single hexahedron in a QT window [QTVTK-box-OpenGL]
- plot and interact with a cylinder in a QT window [QTVTK-cylinder]
- plot and interact with a cylinder in a QT window (OpenGL settings) [QTVTK-cylinder-OpenGL]
