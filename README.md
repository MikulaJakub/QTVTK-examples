# Qt + VTK examples


I wrote these minimalistic examples to learn more about Qt and VTK myself. QT is a powerful tool for creating GUI applications, while VTK is a great opean source visualization library written in C++. Many of the examples presented here are my own `experiments`, and therefore may not be written in the most efficient or optimized way, rather they demonstrate how things can be done.


The examples currently include:

QTVTK-box-OpenGL |  QTVTK-cylinder | VTK-vector-field-on-unstructured-grid
